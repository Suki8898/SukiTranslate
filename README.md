This project was originally created for my own personal use, but I’m sharing it in hopes that it might help someone else out there too! 
Due to my limited brain cells, bugs may appear any where. o((>ω< ))o

The app supports two OCR methods:
- Tesseract (local recognition)
- AI-powered recognition (by sending images to an AI model)

Not all AI models can process images! It depends on the provider and the model's capabilities.

Here are some models known to work with image inputs:
- Google:
    gemini-1.5-flash,
    gemini-2.0-flash,
    etc

- OpenAI:
    gpt-4o-mini,
    gpt-4.1-nano,
    gpt-4o,
    etc

- XAI:
    grok-2-vision-1212
